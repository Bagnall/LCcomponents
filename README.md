# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Run app

npm run dev

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Customising Jigsaw

Jigsaw has an images directory, in here place a correct.jpg and incorrect.jpg image dimensions 	629px x 508px.
It also has a config.json file where you can replace phrases in the languages of your choice, but the instruction 
texts should be in the language of the target user.
The description text should be in the language being learned and should describe the correct.jpg picture sufficiently for the user to pick correct tiles from the pool of correct and incorrect tiles.
